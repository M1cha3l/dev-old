changes to most recent schema plan:
transaction and repair schema merged
sale and carSold schema merged
a few foreign key relationships

our money type is decimal(19,4), which stores numbers in a decimal string

when adding tuples with an auto_increment key, use the value NULL if you don't want to override the auto

auto_increment may be an issue when one tuple needs to know the value to use as its foreign key
eg, when adding an employee, you need to know the customer.custNo which makes auto_increment of little benefit
since you either need to query to find out what it incremented to, or override this feature.
one way to emulate auto_increment is to first query a table using 'SELECT MAX(custNo) FROM customer;'

carPurchaseID and carPurchaseInfo was merged back into carPurchase, since custId does NOT determine date sold.

we changed orders to include a date, and op to include a unit price
