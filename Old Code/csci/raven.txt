Visions of Martin Luther staring at me,
Malcolm X put a hex on my future someone catch me,
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Sarangetti's own,
Back to put you back-stabbers back on your spinal bone,
You slipped your disc when I slipped you my diss,
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick!
