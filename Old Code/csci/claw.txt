Grown men should never bite their tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum.
I got my finger on the muthafkin' trigger,
Aiming it at your head Charlotte's Web is gonna miss ya,
My issue isn't televised so you ain't got to tell the wise
How to stay on beat because our life's an instrumental.
